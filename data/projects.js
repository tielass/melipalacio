Animation is adapted to the dramaturgy of the audio play, with movements in harmony with auditory dynamics at some points, and in contrast at others.

      "Physicists mean by a 'body' and 'radiation' something other than dancers. Our multimedial performance illustrates the interplay of meanings. Black Bodies are not only understood in the performance objectively and physically, but also subjectively; as a metaphor into a limited space, into which photons, atoms, human mind and human bodies act and interact – in other words: dance. The light is the energy that vibrates and oscillates inside this space, inside the blackbody cavity it collides against the walls, pursues not to be confined and heats the body. BLACK BODY RADIATION develops a hybrid language, able to connect science and performing arts rather than to explain scientific theories in the usual words and to provide them with attractive pictures. The scientific revolutions that have moved the human spirit, modern society and science, lay the foundation for such a bridge of communication. With this, scientific discoveries can be exposed to people in an artistic way, so that another vision of science is possible.",

The dramaturgical curve starts at the Planck's blackbody, clips the chemical effects of light on photographic paper and stretches up to the interaction of people in urban areas. The phases of the Performance reflect the mutability over the conception of body: in physical experiments, he is an object, in each subject he is made of flesh and blood, as a city, it contains the body movements of people, lights, emotions and collisions.",

As my body becomes a shadow, it no longer represents only myself but all those who venture beyond their boundaries in search of new territories.
