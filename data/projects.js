The visualization style is based on illustrations of audio play covers by Aiga Rasch/Silvia Christoph, and the style of the 1970s, as the original story dates from this period. Fulldome visualizations show places of the plot to immerse the audience. The three detectives riding a chain carousel, where the visualization turns and transforms in the dome, potentially causing slight dizziness for spectators. Animation is adapted to the dramaturgy of the audio play, with movements in harmony with auditory dynamics at some points, and in contrast at others. Characters are not illustrated directly, but connected with abstract structures for identification with events. Important considerations of the detectives appear in individual typography, forming an outline to the unravelled topic.",

The case leads them to various circus members, a lonely house on the coast, a disused amusement park, and a boat trip on the high seas. This is the new and extended version of the popular classic from 1971.",

These contrasts are reflected in the animation design and the movements, as well as in the position of the dancers. Round, colorful animations combined with flowing movements in dance oppose geometric black and white projections in combination with angular motion sequences and poses. Both characters resemble each other on one side and are contrary on the other side. The performance is an interplay between antagonism, encounter and unity.",

      "Physicists mean by a 'body' and 'radiation' something other than dancers. Our multimedial performance illustrates the interplay of meanings. Black Bodies are not only understood in the performance objectively and physically, but also subjectively; as a metaphor into a limited space, into which photons, atoms, human mind and human bodies act and interact – in other words: dance. The light is the energy that vibrates and oscillates inside this space, inside the blackbody cavity it collides against the walls, pursues not to be confined and heats the body. BLACK BODY RADIATION develops a hybrid language, able to connect science and performing arts rather than to explain scientific theories in the usual words and to provide them with attractive pictures. The scientific revolutions that have moved the human spirit, modern society and science, lay the foundation for such a bridge of communication. With this, scientific discoveries can be exposed to people in an artistic way, so that another vision of science is possible.",
    content:
      "The scenes take place onto semi transparent screens placed at an angle. The performers interact with projections illustrating characteristics of light in different proportions. The dramaturgical curve starts at the Planck's blackbody, clips the chemical effects of light on photographic paper and stretches up to the interaction of people in urban areas. The phases of the Performance reflect the mutability over the conception of body: in physical experiments, he is an object, in each subject he is made of flesh and blood, as a city, it contains the body movements of people, lights, emotions and collisions.",

The goddess's hands open the luminescent curtain. The work of flow begins and thus life is created in conjunction with light. A dancing, pure, brave and serene water plays with the forms inside her, she contains everything, she is self-sufficient. Her atoms, crystals and fluid colors of her contemplate her and play with her body. The lonely and generous Goddess, who can be full and valued, transforms into sound, petals and dance.",
